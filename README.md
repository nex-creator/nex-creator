# 👋 Hi there, I'm Neha Sharma  

### 👩‍💻 About Me  
I’m a **Software Engineer** with over 5 years of experience in **software testing, validation, and automation** for large-scale web, mobile, and enterprise systems.  
I focus on ensuring **reliability, performance, and scalability** through strong **system-level understanding** and **architecture-driven testing**.  

With a background in both **software quality assurance** and **system integration**, I enjoy bridging the gap between development and validation — designing smarter test strategies and automation frameworks that align with product architecture.
